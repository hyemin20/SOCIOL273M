Sent a letter to Equifax on XX/XX/XXXX via mail asking them for an investigation and to verify all the dates and amounts were correct and fix the incorrect reporting on my credit. They did not respond at all so I sent another letter on XX/XX/XXXX via mail, again asking for an investigation and proof. They still didnt respond to that letter so I sent a third letter on XX/XX/XXXX certified mail so I have proof that they signed for my letter.\\n\\nLast week I received two letters from Equifax dated XX/XX/XXXX on the same day. The said that they could not locate my credit file and needed me to send proof of identification and address. With all three letters I sent a copy of my Arizona drivers license and my XXXX direct deposit sub as my proof of address. The second letter said that they received my request to be removed from the promotions list and that it was added to my credit file. How did they find my file to add the restriction if they couldnt find my credit file in regards to investigation purposes?TransUnion has not properly investigated the items below. I am requesting they be removed from my report pending a thorough review. \\n\\nACCOUNTS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX not mine XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2018 unauthorized XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2018 unauthorized XXXX  XXXX XX/XX/2018 unauthorized XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2018 unauthorized XXXX  XXXX I XX/XX/2018 unauthorized XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2018 unauthorized XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2018 unauthorized XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX not mineXX/XX/2020 someone tried to steal my identity by opening up a credit card with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX  XXXX ran a hard inquiry XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  has since been removed from my credit report.

Thank you. \\nXXXX XXXX.I paid the debt on XX/XX/XXXX. I disputed account on credit report on XX/XX/XXXX. Dispute report was finalized on XXXX nothing changed even after presenting supporting documentation. The account still showing incorrect balance.A COLLECTION HAS BEEN REPORTED TO MY CREDIT REPORT THAT IS NOT MINE.this collection is not minesI recently reviewed my credit profile and noticed inaccuracies and false accusations and fraudulent accounts.Ive been cosistent paying my bills on time. I\\'m saying this because I went XXXX XXXX the other day and applied for an account. I got approved but with a {$400.00} deposit. I dint understand until I checked my credit report. I see a couple of items that are not mine. These items need to be deleted from my credit report.I sent in requests to investigate errors on my credit report over 30 days ago, but I have not yet received the response. They were supposed to respond within 30 days, but they have not.I requested for items to be investigated via mail and they have refused to perform the investigation. \\nPlease delete the items on the attached letter from my credit report.Date : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX And XX/XX/XXXX Amount :  {$11000.00} Disputed account on credit report twice and asked for original signed consumer contract on file for the account along with the process that was used to verify information.

Sent multiple rounds of dispute recently was told that my dispute was frivolous and they will not reinvestigate. I have contacted the collection agency requesting for debt to be validated multiple times and received no response ( see certified mail attachment ) however this account remains on my report and XXXX XXXX specifically refuses to reinvestigate or remove it.In XXXX or XX/XX/2019, right around the time I was contacting all the credit bureaus about the name change dispute, I attempted to access my annual credit report through XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and, while I was able to get one from XXXX, I was not able to get one from XXXX until I ordered it by telephone in XXXX since I am completely XXXX. \\nA few days ago, somebody told me that Experian offers a credit boost, in which they consider telephone, internet, and utility as a means for building credit. I tried to sign up for this, but when I answered the verification questions, only one of those questions matched what they had on file. everything else they had was based on random information. I tried to create an account two times, but I was not successful. \\nI called Experian during business hours at +XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX and +XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, but both of these numbers only led to an interactive voice response system with no way to be transferred to a live person to have this resolved.My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX my SS is XXXX DOB XXXX.

PLEASE REMOVE ACCOUNTS IMMEDIATELY AND SEND AN UPDATED COPY OF MY CREDIT REPORT.On XX/XX/XXXX I had a customer file a false dispute on a dress she bought from me. \\n\\nPaypal immediately took {$120.00} from my account within MINUTES of the report and demanded I pay them to bring the account to a positive balance. \\n\\nI did so and complained about the process.. They ignored me. \\n\\nI provided numerous screenshots proving tears and condition were disclosed on the listing, in images AND on the invoice.

I sent emails to Hunter Walfield on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX with a detailed explanation and pointing out that there is no statement in the lease regarding any financial penalty if the tenants not giving 60 day moving-out notice. Also, The vacate form provided and signed by XXXX XXXX Manager specifically stated that if your move out date is after the lease end date, you will be billed the month-to-month rate for any days up to and including your move out date. We moved out before the lease end date XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX still billed us the month-to-month rate from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, which is absolutely a false charge. \\n\\nI have attached photos along with the email to show how well we have cleaned the apartment before we moved out. I have also attached the move-in inspection form to show the pre-existing condition of the apartment in order to prove that there was no damage made by us while living there. \\n\\nI believe the proof and evidence I have provided to Hunter Walfield are sufficient to prove that this is a false charge and we do not own any debt to XXXX XXXX. I have also disputed with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. Yet Hunter Walfield chose to ignore the facts and not have the collection account removed from the XXXX bureaus. After 30 days, all three credit bureaus sent me a letter with \" updated \\'\\' but nothing else regarding the collection account. When I called, I was told to have to go back to ask Hunter Walfield for  the collection account removal.I am having difficulty dealing with and securing information from Windham Professionals located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA XXXX regarding a XXXX  credit card charge off.

Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.\\n\\nThe trade lines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these account without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.\\n\\nI have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.\\n\\nI made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn\\'t have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.\\n\\nLikewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine.

The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.\\n\\nFinally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.\\n\\nInquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is that they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.\\n\\nIt should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.\\n\\nINQUIRIES : XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX |XX/XX/XXXX  XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX |XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  | XX/XX/XXXX I am well aware of my rights as a consumer.

Another hearing was held for me to dispute the {$1700.00}, and at this hearing it was found that only {$230.00} was owed from the illegally added on interest, which was paid on XX/XX/2020, but the court Sustained the Garnishment out of spite because I challenged them, and said they were running a scam.

Please have them remove it because it damaging my score for life and violating my civil financial rights.I had an auto loan with XXXX XXXX  account number XXXX ; my monthly payment of {$1300.00} was due on the XXXX of every month.I was in a near fatal auto accident on XX/XX/XXXX that resulted in a total loss of my vehicle. I was in XXXX on a XXXX  for 12 days. \\nXXXX XXXX was notified of the total loss by my insurance company ; Texas XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX. My auto loan payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX  received a check from Texas XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$67000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a credit alert that XXXX Bank was reporting a 30 day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to all 3 credit bureaus. I immediately called XXXX Bank crying. Customer service was atrocious towards me and I Was not able to get this issue resolved. I was told that the {$67000.00} that XXXX XXXX  received on XX/XX/XXXX did \" not count as a payment because I was not the one that made it. \\'\\' Over the past 15 months I have called XXXX XXXX at least 15 times trying to get this issue resolved. I have been told so many different stories. On XX/XX/XXXX I thought I had finally made some progress when I spoke with \" XXXX \\'\\' in the total loss department at XXXX XXXX. She apologized for what I had been through because of their error. She stated that the processing of the insurance payment was done incorrectly and the payment of {$67000.00} was not back dated to the date of loss of XX/XX/XXXX as it should have been. She told me that she was going to start the process to have the negative information on Experian, XXXX  and XXXX  removed and the account updated to account never late, paid in full and closed. XXXX said that there were two parts to this process, what she was going to submit and that I needed to write a letter to their Credit Bureau Correction department as well. ( I have attached that letter ) A couple weeks ago I received a computer generated letter in the mail that this negative information was not going to be removed from my credit because it was accurate. I honestly just gave up for a while. I was physically and emotional destroyed from the auto accident and the aftermath. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX my mother convinced me to try and contact XXXX XXXX  again. I called and spoke with a \" Ira \\'\\' in their Consumer relations department after customer service refused to let me speak with a supervisor. The representative again expressed her apologies for what I had been through and that XXXX XXXX  still had not fixed their reporting errors. She created a case and gave me a reference number ( XXXX ) and said that this issue would be resolved this time and that the negative information would be removed from all 3 credit bureau reports. After 15 months I thought, \" Finally! \\'\\' Well, Yesterday I received the same computer generated letter that the negative information was NOT going to be removed from my credit and that it was accurate. I am attaching my payment history printed from XXXX XXXX  website a year ago. In the fall of XXXX I logged into my account through XXXX XXXX  website. I noticed that they keep changing payment history and dates and now show that the insurance was applied in XXXX of XXXX ; this is completely false and fraud. i have dispute inaccurate reporting with all 3 credit bureaus over 10 times and provided the payment history as documentation and they tell me that XXXX XXXX is not correcting the information. If you review that dates on the original payment history it is impossible for it to have been 30 days late.I have called Nationstar multiple times to request an update to my escrow as my property taxes are {$0.00} for XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, they published a statement requesting an increase to the escrow because of an increase in insurance premiums. I was told it would only take 10 days to complete the update when I called in XXXX. I did not see an update by mid-XXXX so I called again. I called a third time on XX/XX/XXXX and was promised a call back on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm the update had been made. I did not receive a call so I made another call on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX, the representative told me the update would take effect in 24-48 hours.XXXX XXXX is knowingly reporting false information on my credit profile. I do not have a delinquent balance with XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1400.00}.XXXX, EXPERIAN AND XXXX HAS INACCURATE INFORMATION ON MY CREDIT REPORT.XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXXDispute XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXDispute XXXX XXXX/XXXXDispute XXXX XXXX XXXXDispute XXXX XXXX, XXXXDispute XXXX XXXXDispute XXXX XXXXDispute XXXX XXXXDispute XXXX/XXXX XXXXDispute XXXX/XXXXXXXXDispute all filed to ftc and here violations attached and uploadedIm writing to request assistance with a late payment reported by my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card, which resulted from the card company locking my account due to theft. I would like this late payment removed from my credit history. \\n\\nWhile traveling, my wallet, which contained my credit cards, was stolen. I reported the theft to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card issuer during XX/XX/2020 and my account was locked until a new card was issued to me. My locked account did not allow me to pay my bill that month. When I attempted to pay my bill that month using the online portal, the amount due showing on the locked account was {$0.00} ; no information was provided on whether I would be penalized for not paying my account or if I should use an alternate method for any payments. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020, I received a paper statement that indicated a balance due with a late fee. I went online to attempt to pay and the account remained locked, with a balance of {$0.00}. I contacted XXXX credit card services via telephone to report the issue and they reported that it was an error on their part - due to the system locking my account - and waived the late fee. With the assistance of the customer representative, I paid the amount immediately over the phone for only the amount due, without the late fee. \\n\\nThe bill still appears to be passed due ; however, the late fee which was waived due to the companys administrative errors has adversely impacted my credit score. Ive tried to contact the card servicer directly ; however, due to COVID-19, there have been no staff members to assist me. Therefore, Im requesting CFPBs assistance in correcting my credit history.Credit Acceptance claims I owe them over {$4000.00}. Ive repeatedly tried to contact the finance manager, who will not respond to my calls or mail. I talked to XXXX once on the phone, then he was supposed to call me back and never did. I left several voicemails for him to call me back. I continue to get wrongful late charges on my credit report.I\\'m on XXXX with XXXX  XXXX and XXXX XXXX for low income. XXXX XXXX  {$1500.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX Acc # XXXX Medicredit , Inc. {$350.00} XXXX/XXXX  XXXX, XXXX  Acc # XXXXA purchase was made on a XXXX \\'s credit card approximately four years ago. The purchase was in the amount of about {$40.00}. The charge was paid by personal check through the mail, and did not get posted to the account until several days after the due date. This resulted in a late fee which was more than 50 % of the original purchase. Negotiation attempts were made to settle the fee with no success. The credit company continued to bill the late fee while adding additional fees and interest on top of the fee ( not the original purchase amount ), which ultimately reached an amount of {$310.00} as the balance stands today. The amount trying to be collected is now with a credit agency, Credit Control , LLC. They are requesting a settlement amount of {$140.00}, but again, the original purchase was paid in full which was just {$40.00}.Your full name : XXXX XXXX Current address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX .

I would like to know that my rights are not being violated. Because the reporting of this item is not following the reporting procedures stipulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I request an immediate deletion. \\nPlease pay attention :I have made several attempts to rectify this situation. I have attached all of the correspondence sent below. \\n( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.Ive just reviewed my credit report and I noticed there are two inaccurate late payment items on my report as follows : XXXX XXXX Acct : XXXX : This account is listed as being 30 days late for XXXX of XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. I was never late while paying on this account. \\n\\nUnder the FCRA, erroneous/inaccurate/unverified/unvalidated late payments must be removed. \\n\\nI demand that Experian changes any and all of the inaccurate, erroneous, unverified, and unvalidated late payment marks on my XXXX XXXX account to \" paid as agreed \\'\\'.On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint ( XXXX ) against XXXX for their inaccurate reporting on my credit report. I also made several calls regarding this as well. Last call XX/XX/XXXX because my balance is constantly changing causing my score to drop dramatically while I am trying to purchase a home for my kids and I. I have researched this and found that XXXX has been inaccurately reporting my loans since XX/XX/XXXX. I have late payments reporting XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached proof from the Federal student loans site and also the response from the last complaint that I was in forbearance. I have fought with the credit bureaus as well to have this information updated but XXXX keeps coming back saying that it is correct. This has harmed my reputation with obtaining credit for years and definitely is defamation of character. Since XXXX obviously can not handle accurate reporting I demand these accounts be deleted. \\n\\nUnder the FCRA, consumers can sue for : Statutory damages of {$100.00} {$1000.00} per violation Actual damages for injury the consumer suffered Emotional damages for stress or physical ailments resulting from the ordeal Punitive damages to punish the violator for their actionsI reached out to all three major credit bureaus informing them of the errors that they are currently reporting. I am in the process of purchasing a home and was horrified to discover that my information must have merged with someone elses, because none of what I am seeing is familiar. I AM NOT THE OWNER OF THESE ACCOUNTS. I need them removed immediately. They are causing me distress and impacting the quality of my life. The items that they have been put on notice to remove are as follows :I am a recent victim of identity theft. I am a consumer in pursuant of 15 USC 1692-A3. XXXX, XXXX and Equifax are in violation of 15 USC 1681 ( B ) ( D ) ( G ), failure to delete requested accounts, names, addresses and inquiries, related to identify theft. Please remove requested accounts, names, addresses and inquiries.

XXXX XXXX  originally denied my request to apply for SCRA rights when I enlisted into the XXXX XXXX. The agent I spoke with stated that the loan came before I joined so I was not eligible. After disputing that and over paying for months I finally was able to get my account adjusted and backdated in XXXX of XXXX. I then asked for XXXX XXXX  to update my payment history and payoff amount on my credit report backdating to XXXX of XXXX. \\n\\nThey corrected 2 credit bureaus but not the third.'"
